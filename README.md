# Restaurant

## task 11:
 i had issues with the restaurant form and was able to handle them properly and make sure everything is working and loading correctly and as requested.

 i created a table that contains the attributes that the user inputs into the form, then when the user submits it, it all goes to the table and the fields reset.

 html was used to create the header and footer with all there componennts and css was used to style them as needed. while javascript was used to handle the logic of the data being entered into the form and deal with it.

### What observations or questions do you have about what you’ve learned so far?
	i still dont undestand "DOM, protoype and render" and i desperately need help with it because i dont know what to do, i didnt understand it from the lecture and the online resources got me even more confused.
    
    EDIT: i have been working on understanding DOM manipulation and i think im starting to grasp it.
### How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?
	i have been working on this task for the last 4 hours since i got home from my lectures and i didnt make much progress, i had no idea how much its gonna take me but i had hoped i would make some progress by now.

    EDIT: add 4 more hours to that spent studying and testing what i have been learning.

---------------------------

## task 12:
i migrated the table to the stastics.html file and added the necessary functions with it in stastics.js, its all working well except retreiving the data back, it all goes back as null for some reason even though i hand the getData() function the correct key to retrieve the data back from the local storage.

### What observations or questions do you have about what you’ve learned so far?
    sending data from one page to another through local storage is harder than it needs to be.

### How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?
    it took me around an hour to get where im at at the moment but i hope i will finish it up tomorrow.
